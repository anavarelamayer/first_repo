AlphaFold is a deep learning system developed by DeepMind that predicts
the three-dimensional structure of proteins from their amino acid
sequences. By using neural networks trained on known protein structures,
AlphaFold dramatically improves accuracy over traditional computational
methods and accelerates biological research by enabling structure-based
insights without experimental crystallography.
